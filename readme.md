Sleep deprived brain thinks its a great idea to build this now... so i build it instead of going to sleep üëç

More improvements on the way maybe lol and a deployment :)

# how use?

go to localhost:5000/
log into spotify

then go http://localhost:5000/new_playlist

add your spotify username
add the description / timestamp of video of the playlist
give funny name
submit üí•
